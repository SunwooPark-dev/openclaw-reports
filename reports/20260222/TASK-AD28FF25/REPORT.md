Google, NotebookLM has always
been my favorite tool and it's becoming one of the most essential
AI tools for so many people. It's grounded only
answers from your sources. So minimal hallucination, and even if
you have 50 sources, scatter across multiple formats, it synthesize them
all and find linkage in minutes. And now it's a full content
system turning your sources into slide decks, infographics,
videos, data tables, and more. So in this video I'll show you
seven ways to use NotebookLM so good that it can increase your
work productivity immediately. Let's go so imagine you have high stake
strategy presentation due tomorrow and over 30 industry reports to read. You just don't have time
to go through all of them. But what if you let AI do deep research,
synthesize them into ready to use presentation in minutes, and this is
exactly where NotebookLM can help. For example, you need to present the
content marketing trends for your annual strategy planning to your leadership. So first, let's create a new notebook. So there are three panels, the source
sections to upload at least 50 sources. The chat panel to prompt with your
sources, the studio panel to create content output with just one click. And if you don't have any sources, you can
actually use the research functions, right inside NotebookLM which is a great help. So fast research is for
quick scan for sources. The research does for full analysis with
the report, and with much more sources. So one tip is you can prompt it with
your research focus the prioritized, reputable source or any trustworthy
source in your field, and most importantly, the timeframe for the source. Now, NotebookLM is planning the research,
executing the step and generating the deep research report with all the source links. So it is using the authority source like
Forrester, Gartner, that I specified. And you can just one click
to input all these sources. Now the first thing is to
ask some strategic question. And one that I like is actually
ask it to propose question that you should be asking, like what are
the five most important question a marketing leader should be asking
about the content strategy this year? So rather than summarizing the
information notebook, NotebookLM will distill the most critical priority
to challenge your own thinking. And I really like this one. Are we producing enough "be the source"
content to maintain the authority. Then I recommend you save it as
a note for future reference, to keep them organized, even though
notebookLM has built in chat history. Another one is the gap analysis question. So asking what are the missing
sources to dive deeper, which could be critical for the strategy? Then it will give you the critical
evaluation on the source quality and what are the missing pieces. So giving you a perspective you
might not have considered yourself. Then we are ready to build a slide deck. And the tip is to first create a new
notes called slide deck specification with the instructions, like the
audience slide counts, structure, style, so it's like a reusable playbook
that you can reference every time. Now copy this instruction. Click slide deck and pick
presenter slide, which I recommend. So paste the specification prompt together
with the content focus and click generate. And so you can see the generated
deck will follow the specification that we set, the color scheme,
the style, the content structure. And personally, I found the
storytelling from NotebookLM slide deck is really great. It's powered by the nano banana
image model that is superior. It's just very high quality and gives
me lots of ideas on how I can present the messy information in a clear way. Now you have seen how NotebookLM
handles research and content creation in one single workflow. And later in this video I'll show you
how it becomes even more powerful when you combine it with Gemini that actually
complement each other really well. So if you want to understand how different
AI tools actually work together, then these free resource I created together
with HubSpot called the "AI Toolkit I use every week" is what you need. You can find the link below. This guide breaks down my favorite
use cases when using AI chat bots and tools like ChatGPT, Claude,
Gemini, and Perplexity, the specific scenarios where each two shines
and how they fit into my workflow. What I'm excited to share are the ready
to use prompts for common work scenarios like audience research, strategy planning. They serve as starting points where you
can customize for your own approach. you can download for free
in the description below. And thank HubSpot for
sponsoring this video. All right. NotebookLM can do research when
you're starting from scratch. But what about when you already
have the sources but scattered across different formats, documents,
presentations, spreadsheets. And this is where NotebookLM becomes
your custom AI expert, and turn these scattered notes in a set of
ready to use professional content. So for example, you are brand
managing different client projects and oftentimes it has so many files,
call transcript, project scope document, strategy deck, performance
data, industry research reports, and even some raw written note image. And the great thing is NotebookLM
support diverse formats and integrate directly with Google Drive so
everything can stay organized. So before we even generate any
outputs, you can first configure this notebook with a custom persona. So we can then give it a role of a
growth strategist with the project context, tone, and areas to prioritize. So let's test it by first asking the
coming biggest priority for the project. So you can see it is following
the persona, focus on the actions and also follow potential risk
and ask clarifying question. Now you can let it synthesize
all the materials and output different reports for internal use. So click report, you'll see both the
default formats and those suggested based on the notebook context. So for this case, let's pick
project overview and I suggest not to change the prompt, immediately
it summarize the details into the project document report format. And we can just one click to
export it to Google document, which is super convenient. And now your teammate can access
the same project document anytime. But we are not done yet. So we can even generate a launch roadmap
infographic that's support this document. So click infographic and it support
different languages orientation. And we can customize using the brand color
and style that match this client brand. And you can see the generated infographic
perfectly captured the exact style that I want and makes it easy to understand
the project roadmap at a glance. Now you can just copy it
as part of your document. And even more now we can
create an SOP document that the team can always reference to. So this time pick the create own
option, give it the SOP details. Then quickly we have
these SOP documents built. Outline all the key step about how
the team should handle the client feedback with escalation protocol. And this is the power of NotebookLM. And to take it further, we can
reimport this SOP Google document as a source and then only select it as
a source and then create a process infographic with the same brand style. And now everything looks
much more complete. And then you can just click here to share
this client project to your teammate so they can catch up the progress anytime
and dig insights from this notebook. Now, those infographics looks amazing,
but what if you could bring your own brand assets into the mix, upload
a character or visual elements, and have NotebookLM incorporated it. And I found the results
can be surprisingly good. And let me show you what is possible. For example, you are a social
media marketer of a home organization service company. And you are finding some YouTube
sources to help prepare a social media infographic about the home
organization tips and NotebookLM supports bulk upload with source links. So just gather all the YouTube
links, paste the list of URLs and click import it's very easy. Now, let's say we have this brand
character asset, it is an owl, and we want to let NotebookLM to use it for
the branded infographic generation. So first, upload this image as a source. So our first infographic is about 10 tips
for home organization for small space. So again, click infographic, pick
the language and orientation, and in the prompt, specify the type
of infographic, the hand-drawing style, which is my favorite. And make sure notebookLM will use
this brand character throughout the infographic and the results is pretty
amazing with the character being used that makes it super engaging and you
can just one click to download it. Now let's try another one. So this time we gonna first
generate the infographic copy first. So let's ask it to draft the room by
room home organization infographic with the details using the sources. Now you have the copy with the
headline, and what I really like is you can just save it as a note and then
immediately convert it into a source. And then just select the brand
character and this source to generate the new infographic. And this time let's do a square
orientation and try a whiteboard marker style and a grid layout. So quickly. Another amazing infographic
is generated and every copy is following the new source. Now I should mention NotebookLM has tight
safety filter around the brand characters, especially those with faces or copyright
protection so it can be hit or miss. So to make consistent results, you
can use Germinal app or Google AI Studio, same model, but it follows
the character details more reliably. All right. So far we've turned different materials
into professional outputs, but NotebookLM is also powerful tool for learning. Personally, I have used it to learn
unfamiliar topics so much faster, and the podcast style audio is must
know when it comes to learning. And this is also why so
many people love NotebookLM. So for example, you're a
marketer and you want to keep yourself updated in the field. So first we can go to perplexity to find
the most updated sources in the digital marketing field and only output the URLs. So here I like using perplexity
is because it gives me the more current and timely sources, and
then copy this list of sources. So on NotebookLM paste the
source list and bulk upload them. Now for learning purpose, I highly
recommend first generating the mind map that will show you the high
level visual structure about the key themes and how each of them connects. Before you even deep dive into
the details so you can quickly grab the full landscape in one go. And then we can generate the podcast
style audio overview, which is a signature feature of NotebookLM. So click this at the icon
to customize the audio. So here you can pick different formats,
like deep dive critique, change how the hosts present the information and
the length, and we can include more context about what this podcast is about,
the target audience, what content to focus, in what amount of proportion,
and how the hosts should interact. And then click generate. And after a few minutes,
the audio is ready. and the hosts just followed
the flow that I have specified. And you can also click the
interactive mode icons to join the podcast and ask question. And the AI hosts will
answer based on the sources. And what is even more powerful is
now you can access this podcast audio on the mobile as well. So just download the NotebookLM
mobile app, open the same notebook, and listen to audio on the go. And this will make it easy to turn your
commute workout into learning time without extra effort, and I highly recommend it. Now, learning for yourself is one
thing, but what about training a team or preparing a workshop? A course, creating these materials
from scratch can take a long time, but now NotebookLM can build
your entire training package, all from the same source materials. And let me show you For example, you're preparing an internal
training workshop about cloude code. So here we have import all the official
documentation about cloud code. It's 50 of them. Now, let's first ask it to design
a two hour training workshop about the topic with the target
audience and output details. And then it give us this detailed
workshop outline, which is fantastic with the learning objectives, lesson
breakdown that have six parts in total, and then save it as a note for later use. Now generate the video lesson
for part one of the workshop. First, we're gonna copy the
outline generated by NotebookLM, and then click on video overview. So we will pick the explainer
format as this is for a workshop. So NotebookLM also lets you customize
the visual style for this video overview. And let's try the custom style where
you can describe your own visual style. And then for the customization,
prompt paste back the outline. we just copied and then use this
prompt to include the context and tone, and then click generate. And so you can see the generative
video is impressive is using the task book illustration style that I specify
and following the lesson outline. So with this method, you can let
NotebookLM to follow the outline while using all the sources to generate
the video lesson, and let's also generate the training slide deck. And again, copy the lesson outline,
click slide deck, pick the presenter slide for more visual impact, and
then paste back the lesson outline. And then include the context detail. And especially we will ask it to include
a friendly bear character to narrate the slide to make it even more engaging. And look at this. This is very well done with the character
used throughout the deck making it much more interesting for the training
purpose following the content structure. And this is why I think the notebook
slide slider is such a game changer. And I also try using the Claude
moscot, but you can see NotebookLM interpreted as a cloud character, which
honestly turns out pretty amazing too. So don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes it may surprise you. Now, let's also generate a quiz
as part of the training materials, just click the quiz icon, specify
the number of questions, difficulty level, and a focus topic of the quiz. And then very quickly the quiz is
ready and it's fully functional. So now you have the complete training
package from the same sources, all inside Now, another of my favorite use
cases is doing competitive research. So as marketers, you need to understand
what competitors are saying, how they are positioning, and normally you
spend hours digging through websites or pages copying into spreadsheets. But now with NotebookLM, you can take
all that and turn it into structured data that you can actually analyze. So let's say you're doing competitive
messaging research about different email marketing tools on the market. So first we can use Google AI Mode and ask
it to give us the top 20 email marketing platforms and output just the URLs. So this list is gold as this is what
even an AI search engines recommend, so the messaging is worth studying. And then copy this list and then
bulk import back to NotebookLM. and rename this notebook. Now another incredible content
output is the data table. So just describe the data table details. So for this case, I need a table to have
columns, like the tool name, headlines, target audience value proposition, etc. And then click generate. And less than a minute, it
helps us transform these messy, unstructured information into
clean organize roles and columns. And then you can even one click here
to export it directly to Google Sheets that you can actually work with. So a structured database summarizing
all the 20 email marketing tools that are ready for analysis,
filtering, or sharing with the team. And we can even take it further. So since we have already built this Google
sheets, so we can reimport this into NotebookLM as a source, and the magic
happens as we just select this source and then click infographic and ask it to
create a competitor messaging landscape infographic grouped by the audience type. And NotebookLM did it. Again, summarizing the positioning pattern
for these tools, grouped by the target audience with our specified visual style. So at one glance, you can
see the patterns, the gaps, and where the opportunity is. Alright,  So everything we built
live inside NotebookLM, but here is where it gets even more powerful
by combining it with Gemini. You can now bring your entire notebook
into Gemini and turn it into something interactive, a landing page, a dashboard,
an app, something you can share with your team with just one click. So for example, you are learning
or researching about a new subject. So in this case it's about sleep science. And with NotebookLM you already build
different artifacts that support the learning video overview, infographic slide
deck, and now a powerful workflow into import this whole notebook into Gemini. So on Gemini web app, click add file, pick
NotebookLM, and then select this notebook. And then turn on the canvas
mode, as we will ask it to create an interactive landing page. And then use this prompt to ask it
to build a fully functional landing page to visualize the notebook
materials, specify the visual style and the content to include. And within five minutes, Gemini model
build this stunning landing page. And I found Gemini is exceptionally
good at front end UX design. And you can see it follows my instructions
to add the subtle animation so you can actually see there are some
stars floating that nails the sleep aesthetic, which I absolutely love it. And there's a sleeping logo
in the hero section, which has some subtle effect as well. And the rest of the section
is also very interactive. So the sleep cycle explanation,
the flipping cards for the myth, self-assessment tools, and even there
is a chatbot widget that guide the visitors on the popular  question. So you get the idea. NotebookLM is your second brain. So it holds the facts,
the source and the truth. And Gemini is your builder. So it take that information and give
it a beautiful, interactive body. And there's still so many possibilities
when you bring Gemini into this workflow. So think about what are the unique
things that Gemini can do and apply the same concepts into your own workflow. If you enjoyed this video,
please give me a thumbs up. I really appreciate that. I also encourage you
to join our community. We actually did a notebook outline
workshop where we go even deeper into structuring notebooks and
turning it into a content system. So every month we have a different
specialized workshop about AI and marketing, and you'll unlock all
the assets and all the resources. You can find a link in the description
to join, and before you go, also watch this video about Gemini for marketing
if you are a big fan of Google ai. I'll see you next time.
